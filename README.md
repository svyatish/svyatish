## Hi, I'm Yatish Sonnenahalli Vijaya Kumar! 👋

Data Analyst with a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data visualization. Recently completed an MSc in Data Science and Analytics from Cardiff University, where I partnered with Public Health Wales to analyze maternal BMI and congenital anomalies using MySQL, Python, and Tableau.

I'm passionate about turning data into insights that drive decision-making, and I enjoy working on projects across public health, marketing analytics, and performance reporting.
